## 🗂 Project Structure

This project is organized into two files:

### 📁 `index.html`

This file contains the HTML structure for the chessboard. It creates the chessboard layout with rows and boxes representing each square. Chess pieces are represented using Unicode symbols.

### 📁 `style.css`

This file contains the CSS styles for the chessboard:

- **`html` and `body` Styles:** Sets the background color, dimensions, and centers the content.
- **`row` Class:** Defines the height and floating behavior of rows.
- **`box` Class:** Sets dimensions, text alignment, color, and hover effects for chessboard squares.
- **`black` Class:** Applies a black background color to specific squares.

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

1. **Open the Project:**
   - Ensure you have both `index.html` and `style.css` in the same directory.
   - Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the chessboard layout.

2. **Interact with the Chessboard:**

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

- **Interactive Chessboard:** Implement functionality for moving pieces and managing game logic.
- **Responsive Design:** Adjust styling to make the chessboard responsive on different screen sizes.
